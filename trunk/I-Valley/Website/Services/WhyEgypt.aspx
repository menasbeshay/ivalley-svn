               Why Outsourcing to Egypt? </h2>
<p>
               In the A.T. Kearney
                Global Services Location Index™, 2011, Egypt was named the fourth most attractive
                location in the world for offshore services. The country has scored consistently
                well over time because of its economical wage rates and large supply of talent.
                The Egyptian government has also actively promoted the sector abroad while aggressively
                pushing industry to bring its standards up to international levels. These reports
                not only demonstrate the leaps that Egypt has made in terms of infrastructure, talent
                and attractiveness as an outsourcing destination but show the world what Egypt has
                to offer local and multinational companies.
