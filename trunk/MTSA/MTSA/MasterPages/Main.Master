                      <h4>Herzogenaurach (HQ)</h4>
                      <p>Known as the “base,” Herzogenaurach is located near Nuremberg in the heart of Bavaria. A one thousand year old town where the sports industry began in a shoe factory owned by the Dassler brothers, Herzogenaurach is still home to the adidas global headquarters. If you’d like to work at the birthplace of the iconic three stripes, check out our jobs in Herzogenaurach.</p>

                    <div class="canton">
                      <h4>Canton</h4>
                      <p>Canton is located just outside of Boston and is home to our Reebok World Headquarters and our adidas Sports Licensed Design team. Just a short commute and you are in Boston, the city for the hungry. Whether your appetite is sated by food, sport, art, or politics, you’ll find what you crave in historic Boston. A city of world-renowned institutions, Boston is abuzz with intense rivalries and intellectual and athletic fervor, infusing our designers with a single mindedness of intention-to design serious fanwear for serious fans.

                      <h4>Portland</h4>
                      <p>Portland is authentic. It’s a generous natural setting—located at the confluence of two major rivers and surrounded by dense forests and impressive mountains.  Not only are Portland’s residents active runners, hikers, cyclists, and climbers, but Portland is a city committed to innovative thinking about sustainable and eco-friendly design.  If you like the feel of a self-styled city that thrives because of the uniqueness of its businesses and residents, you’ll love Portland, Oregon. </p>

                      <h4>Shanghai</h4>
                      <p>Shanghai is the hotspot of modern China. History, culture, and consumerism converge in this attractive city located at the mouth of the Yangtze river. From the Bund with its colonial elegance to Pudong with its futuristic radiance, Shanghai is a city where the past always has a view of the future and the future always has a view of the past. As China’s fashion center, Shanghai has become one of the most influential and innovative design cities in the world.</p>

                      <h4>Tokyo</h4>
                      <p>Originally a small fishing village, Tokyo has become the cosmopolitan capital of Japan. It is a city of contrasting energies, where the past and the present live side by side. So whether it is the subtle and intimate elegance of traditional Japanese Noh theatre or the vivid and hyper-vertical glare of shibuya’s Times Square that ignites your imagination, Tokyo has something for you. In other words, if real life juxtaposition makes you want to grab a pen and sketch, check out our design studio here.</p>
